# Actually-Exciting-Pong

Some improvements made to a Pong-like game concept (single player Pong with high score count), like:
- Ability to shoot multiple shots (Up arrow)
- Paddle freezes for some time when hitting the ball
- Paddle gets smaller after every hit
- Shot accelerates or slows ball depending on whether the ball was approaching or going away
- Score per time calculation
- Ball accelerates after hitting paddle
- Ball goes redder the faster it goes

Controls:

Move with the Left and Right arrow keys and use the Up arrow key to shoot up to 4 shots.
